# Text-Summarisation
Text summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to condense large volumes of text into shorter, coherent versions while preserving key information and overall meaning. There are two main types of text summarization:

Extractive Summarization: This method involves selecting and concatenating important sentences or phrases directly from the original text without altering them. The focus is on identifying the most relevant information to form a summary.

Abstractive Summarization: Unlike extractive summarization, this approach generates new sentences that capture the core ideas of the original text. It often involves advanced techniques such as deep learning and language modeling to produce more human-like summaries.

Text summarization is widely used in various applications, including news aggregation, document management, and content recommendation systems. By automating the summarization process, it helps users quickly grasp the essential points from extensive textual data.
